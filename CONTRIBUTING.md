## Tutorial guidelines

This section demonstrates all the instructions for developing a lesson in the
[ESMValTool tutorial][tutorial-site]. The tutorial is a set of lessons (or
episodes) that together teach **basic** skills needed to work with
[ESMValTool][ESMValTool-doc] in climate-related domains.

### Lesson development

The content of this tutorial is mainly developed based on the [Carpentries
Curriculum Development Handbook][swc-handbook]. The handbook explains why we
teach the way we do, and why our lessons are designed the way they are. If you
are contributing to existing lesson materials, please make sure the content
conforms to the concepts provided in the handbook.

We recommend using software to check spelling or grammatical errors. The
following link will guide you through a list of tools for several editors:
<http://wiki.languagetool.org/software-that-supports-languagetool-as-a-plug-in-or-add-on>

### Lesson organization

Each lesson is made up of episodes, which are focused on a particular topic and
include time for both teaching and exercises. If you are making a new episode,
please make sure the content conforms to the [Carpentries lesson
organization][swc-lesson-organization].

### Lesson formatting

Episodes are [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) files. If you
are making a new episode or contributing to existing ones, please make sure the
content conforms to the [Carpentries lesson formatting][swc-lesson-formatting].

We also recommend using a linter to check errors in Markdown files. For
example, a
[markdownlint](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=DavidAnson.vscode-markdownlint)
can be installed as an extension in [Visual Studio
Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/). Alternatively, a linter can be installed
with:

```bash
gem install mdl
```

and can be used as:

```bash
mdl your_markdown_filename
```

We use [Codacy](https://app.codacy.com/gh/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool_Tutorial)
as an automated code analysis services. To run the analyis
[locally](https://github.com/codacy/codacy-analysis-cli)
on Markdown files with Docker use

```bash
docker run \
  --rm=true \
  --env CODACY_CODE=${PWD} \
  --volume /var/run/docker.sock:/var/run/docker.sock \
  --volume ${PWD}:${PWD} \
  --volume /tmp:/tmp \
  codacy/codacy-analysis-cli \
  analyse --tool remark-int
```

### Previewing your changes locally

If you are making a new episode or contributing to existing ones,
please preview changes on your machine before submitting a
[pull request][PR]. To do so, you need to install
the software described below:

```bash
# apt (Ubuntu/Devian)
sudo apt install ruby-dev ruby-bundler
```

or

```bash
# dnf (Fedora/Redhat)
sudo dnf install rubygem-bundler ruby-devel
```

Alternatively, there is an environment file available which can be installed
with:

```bash
conda env create -f environment.yml -n esmvaltool_tutorial
```

To install the required ruby packages, run the following command in the
tutorial's main directory to build and serve the website locally:

```bash
make serve
```

The output on the terminal will contain a line similar to:

```bash
Server address: http://127.0.0.1:4000
```

This address can be opened in your browser to preview the tutorial website.

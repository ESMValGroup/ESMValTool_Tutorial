## What is ESMValTool?

This tutorial is a first introduction to ESMValTool. Before diving into the
technical steps, let's talk about what ESMValTool is all about.

## A tool to analyse climate data

ESMValTool takes care of finding, opening, checking, fixing, concatenating, and
preprocessing CMIP data and several other supported datasets.

The central component of ESMValTool that we will see in this tutorial is the
**recipe**. Any ESMValTool recipe is basically a set of instructions to reproduce
a certain result. The basic structure of a recipe is as follows:

- **Documentation** with relevant (citation) information
- **Datasets** that should be analysed
- **Preprocessor** steps that must be applied
- **Diagnostic** scripts performing more specific evaluation steps

An example recipe could look like this:

```yaml
documentation:
  title: This is an example recipe.
  description: Example recipe
  authors:
    - lastname_firstname

datasets:
  - {dataset: HadGEM2-ES, project: CMIP5, exp: historical, mip: Amon, 
     ensemble: r1i1p1, start_year: 1960, end_year: 2005}

preprocessors:
  global_mean:
    area_statistics:
      operator: mean

diagnostics:
  hockeystick_plot:
    description: plot of global mean temperature change
    variables:
      temperature:
        short_name: tas
        preprocessor: global_mean
    scripts: hockeystick.py
```

## A collection of diagnostics for reproducible climate science

More than a tool, ESMValTool is a collection of publicly available recipes and
diagnostic scripts. This makes it possible to easily reproduce important
results.

> ## Explore the available recipes
>
> Go to the [ESMValTool Documentation webpage](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/) and
> explore the `Available recipes` section. Which recipe(s) would you like to
> try?

## A community effort

ESMValTool is built and maintained by an active community of scientists and
software engineers. It is an open source project to which anyone can contribute.
Many of the interactions take place on GitHub. Here, we briefly introduce you to
some of the most important pages.

> ## Meet the ESMValGroup
>
> Go to [github.com/ESMValGroup](https://github.com/ESMValGroup). This is
> the GitHub page of our 'organization'. Have a look around. How many collaborators are
> there? Do you know any of them?
>
> Near the top of the page there are 2 pinned repositories: ESMValTool and
> ESMValCore. Visit each of the repositories. How many people have contributed
> to each of them? Can you also find out how many people have contributed to
> this tutorial?

> ## Issues and pull requests
>
> Go back to the repository pages of
> [ESMValTool](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool) or
> [ESMValCore](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValCore). There are tabs for
> 'issues' and 'pull requests'. You can use the labels to navigate them a bit
> more. How many open issues are about enhancements of ESMValTool? And how many
> bugs have been fixed in ESMValCore? There is also an 'insights' tab, where you
> can see a summary of recent activity. How many issues have been opened and
> closed in the past month?

## Conclusion

This concludes the introduction of the tutorial. You now have a basic knowledge
of ESMValTool and its community. The following episodes will walk you through
the installation, configuration and running your first recipes.

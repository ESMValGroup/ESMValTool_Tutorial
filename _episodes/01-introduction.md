Typically, the introduction talk introduces ESMValTool with a focus on how the front-end interface works from a users perspective. Thereâ€™s no need for an in-depth discussion of how the backend works here. Instead, this talk should include:

- Introduction to ESMValTool project
- The difference between ESMValTool and ESMValCore
- How preprocessors and preprocessor chains work
- How diagnostics work
- The config-user.yml file
- How to include model and observational data in a recipe
- Examples of recipes including plots and results that are included in the main branch.

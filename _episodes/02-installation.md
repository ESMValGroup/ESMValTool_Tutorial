## Overview

The instructions help with the installation of ESMValTool on operating systems
like Linux/MacOSX/Windows.
We use the [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)
package manager to
install the ESMValTool. Other installation methods are also available; they can
be found in the
[documentation](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html).
We will first install Mamba, and then ESMValTool. We end this chapter by testing
that the installation was successful.

Before we begin, here are all the possible ways in which you can use ESMValTool
depending on your level of expertise or involvement with ESMValTool and 
associated software such as GitHub and Mamba.

1. If you have access to a server where ESMValTool is already installed
as a module, for e.g., the [CEDA JASMIN](https://help.jasmin.ac.uk/article
/4955-community-software-esmvaltool)
server, you can simply load the module with the following command:
~~~bash
module load esmvaltool
~~~
After loading ``esmvaltool``, we can start using ESMValTool right away. Please
 see the [next lesson]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/03-configuration.md %}). 
2. If you would like to install ESMValTool as a mamba package, then this lesson
will tell you how!
3. If you would like to start experimenting with existing diagnostics or 
contributing to ESMvalTool, please see the instructions for 
source installation in the lesson [Development and
contribution]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/07-development-setup.md %}) and
in the [documentation](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html).

> ## Install ESMValTool on Windows
>
> ESMValTool does not directly support Windows, but successful usage has been
> reported through the [Windows Subsystem for
> Linux(WSL)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/),
> available in Windows 10.
> To install the WSL please follow the instructions [on the Windows Documentation
> page](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/install-win10).
> After installing the WSL, installation can be done using the same instructions for
> [Linux/MacOSX](#install-esmvaltool-on-linuxmacosx).

## Install ESMValTool on Linux/MacOSX

### Install Mamba

ESMValTool is distributed using [Mamba](https://mamba.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html).
To install mamba on ``Linux`` or ``MacOSX``, follow the  instructions below:

1.  Please download the installation file for the latest Mamba version 
[here](https://github.com/conda-forge/miniforge#mambaforge).

2.  Next, run the installer from the place where you downloaded it:

    On ``Linux``:

    ```bash
    bash Mambaforge-Linux-x86_64.sh
    ```

    On ``MacOSX``:

    ```bash
    bash Mambaforge-MacOSX-x86_64.sh
    ```

3.  Follow the instructions in the installer. The defaults should normally
    suffice.

4.  You will need to restart your terminal for the changes to have effect.

5.  We recommend updating mamba before the esmvaltool installation. To do so, run:

    ```bash
    mamba update --name base mamba
    ```

6.  Verify you have a working mamba installation by: 

    ```bash
    which mamba
    ```

    This should show the path to your mamba executable, e.g. `~/mambaforge/bin/mamba`.

For more information about installing mamba,
see [the mamba installation documentation](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en
/latest/quickstart/installation.html#mamba-installation).

### Install the ESMValTool package

The ESMValTool package contains diagnostics scripts in four languages: R,
Python, Julia and NCL. This introduces a lot of dependencies, and therefore the
installation can take quite long. It is, however, possible to install
'subpackages' for each of the languages. The following (sub)packages are
available:

- `esmvaltool-python`
- `esmvaltool-ncl`
- `esmvaltool-r`
- `esmvaltool` --> the complete package, i.e. the combination of the above.

For the tutorial, we will install the complete package. Thus, to install the
ESMValTool package, run

```bash
mamba create --name esmvaltool esmvaltool 'python=3.10'
```

On MacOSX ESMValTool functionalities in Julia, NCL, and R are not supported. To install
a Mamba environment on MacOSX, please refer to specific [information](https://
docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/quickstart/installation.html#installation-on-
macosx).

This will create a new [Mamba
environment](https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks
/manage-environments.html)
called `esmvaltool`, with the ESMValTool package and all of its dependencies
installed in it.

### Install Julia

Some ESMValTool diagnostics are written in the Julia programming language.
If you want a full installation of ESMValTool including Julia diagnostics, you need
to make sure Julia is installed before installing ESMValTool.

In this tutorial, we will not use Julia, but for reference, we have listed the steps
to install Julia below.
Complete instructions for installing Julia can be found on the [Julia
installation page](https://julialang.org/downloads/platform/#linux_and_freebsd).

> ## Julia installation instructions
>
> First, open a bash terminal and activate the newly created `esmvaltool` environment.
>
> ```bash
> conda activate esmvaltool
> ```
>
> Next, to install Julia via `mamba`, you can use the following command:
>
> ```bash
> mamba install julia
> ```
> 
> To check that the Julia executable can be found, run
>
> ```bash
> which julia
> ```
>
> to display the path to the Julia executable, it should be
>
> ```
> ~/mambaforge/envs/esmvaltool/bin/julia
> ```
> {: .output}
>
> To test that Julia is installed correctly, run
>
> ```bash
> julia
> ```
>
> to start the interactive Julia interpreter. Press `Ctrl+D` to exit.

### Test that the installation was successful

To test that the installation was successful, run

```bash
conda activate esmvaltool
```

to activate the conda environment called `esmvaltool`. In the shell prompt the
active conda environment should have been changed from `(base)` to
`(esmvaltool)`.

Next, run

```bash
esmvaltool --help
```

to display the command line help.

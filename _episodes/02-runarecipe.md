This episode describes how ESMValTool recipes work, how to run a recipe and how
to explore the recipe output. By the end of this episode, you should be able to
run your first recipe, look at the recipe output, and make small modifications.

## Import module in GADI
You may want to open VS Code with a remote SSH connection to Gadi and use the VS Code terminal,
then you can later view the recipe file. 
Refer to [VS Code setup]({{ page.root }}{% link _extras/01-vscodesetup.md %}).

In a terminal with an SSH connection into Gadi, load the module to use ESMValTool on Gadi.
```bash
module use /g/data/xp65/public/modules
module load esmvaltool
```

## Running an existing recipe

The recipe format has briefly been introduced in the 
[Introduction][lesson-introduction] episode. To see all the
recipes that are shipped with ESMValTool, type

```bash
esmvaltool recipes list
```

We will start by running [examples/recipe_python.yml](https://docs.esmvaltool.
org/en/latest/recipes/recipe_examples.html).
This is the command with ESMValTool installed.
```
esmvaltool run examples/recipe_python.yml
```
On Gadi, this can be done using the `esmvaltool-workflow` wrapper in the loaded module.
```bash
esmvaltool-workflow run examples/recipe_python.yml
```
or if you have the user configuration file in your current directory then

```bash
esmvaltool-workflow run --config_file ./config-user.yml examples/recipe_python.yml
```

If everything is okay, you should see that ESMValTool is printing a lot of
output to the command line. The final message should be "Run was successful".
The exact output varies depending on your machine, but it should look something
like the example log output on terminal below.

{% include example_output.txt %}

On Gadi with `esmvaltool-workflow` you will see the wrapper has run esmvaltool in a
PBS job for you, when complete you can find the output directory, including this
output log.

> ## Pro tip: ESMValTool search paths
>
> You might wonder how ESMValTool was able find the recipe file, even though
> it's not in your working directory. All the recipe paths printed from
> `esmvaltool recipes list` are relative to ESMValTool's installation location.
> This is where ESMValTool will look if it cannot find the file by following the
> path from your working directory.

## Investigating the log messages

Let's dissect what's happening here.


> ## Output files and directories
>
> After the banner and general information, the output starts with some important locations.
>
> 1. Did ESMValTool use the right config file?
> 1. What is the path to the example recipe?
> 1. What is the main output folder generated by ESMValTool?
> 1. Can you guess what the different output directories are for?
> 1. ESMValTool creates two log files. What is the difference?
>
> > ## Answers
> >
> > 1. The config file should be the one we edited in the previous episode,
> >    something like `/home/<username>/.esmvaltool/config-user.yml` or
 `~/esmvaltool_tutorial/config-user.yml`.
> > 1. ESMValTool found the recipe in its installation directory, 
>> something like
> >    `/home/users/username/mambaforge/envs/esmvaltool/bin/esmvaltool/recipes/examples/`
>> or if you are using a pre-installed module on a server, something like
>> `/apps/jasmin/community/esmvaltool/ESMValTool_<version>
>>/esmvaltool/recipes/examples/recipe_python.yml`, 
>> where `<version>` is the latest release.
> > 1. ESMValTool creates a time-stamped output directory for every run. In this
> >    case, it should be something like `recipe_python_YYYYMMDD_HHMMSS`. This
> >    folder is made inside the output directory specified in the previous
> >    episode: `~/esmvaltool_tutorial/esmvaltool_output`.
> > 1. There should be four output folders:
> >    - `plots/`: this is where output figures are stored.
> >    - `preproc/`: this is where pre-processed data are stored.
> >    - `run/`: this is where esmvaltool stores general information about the
> >      run, such as log messages and a copy of the recipe file.
> >    - `work/`: this is where output files (not figures) are stored.
> > 1. The log files are:
> >    - `main_log.txt` is a copy of the command-line output
> >    - `main_log_debug.txt` contains more detailed information that may be
> >      useful for debugging.
> >
> {: .solution}
{: .challenge}

> ## Debugging: No 'preproc' directory?
>
> If youâ€™re missing the preproc directory, then your `config-user.yml` file has
> the value `remove_preproc_dir` set to `true` (this is used to save disk space).
> Please set this value to `false` and run the recipe again.
>
{: .callout}

After the output locations, there are two main sections that can be
distinguished in the log messages:

- Creating tasks
- Executing tasks

> ## Analyse the tasks
>
> List all the tasks that ESMValTool is executing for this recipe. Can you guess
> what this recipe does?
>
> > ## Answer
> >
> > Just after all the 'creating tasks' and before 'executing tasks', we find the
> > following line in the output:
> >
> > ```
> >[134535] INFO    These tasks will be executed: map/tas, timeseries/tas_global, 
>>timeseries/script1, map/script1, timeseries/tas_amsterdam
> > ```
> >
> > So there are three tasks related to timeseries: global temperature,
> > Amsterdam temperature, and a script (*tas*: near-surface air temperature). And
> > then there are two tasks related to a map: something with temperature, and
> > again a script.

## Examining the recipe file

To get more insight into what is happening, we will have a look at the recipe
file itself. Use the following command to copy the recipe to your working
directory (eg. in `\scratch\nf33\$USERNAME\`)

```bash
esmvaltool recipes get examples/recipe_python.yml
```

Now you should see the recipe file in your working directory (type `ls` to
verify). Use VS Code to open this file, you should be able to open from your
explorer panel:

![recipe_python.yml](../fig/vs_code_recipefile.png)

For reference, you can also view the recipe by unfolding the box below.

Do you recognize the basic recipe structure that was introduced in episode 1?

- **Documentation** with relevant (citation) information
- **Datasets** that should be analysed
- **Preprocessors** groups of common preprocessing steps
- **Diagnostics** scripts performing more specific evaluation steps

> ## Analyse the recipe
>
> Try to answer the following questions:
>
> 1. Who wrote this recipe?
> 1. Who should be approached if there is a problem with this recipe?
> 1. How many datasets are analyzed?
> 1. What does the preprocessor called `annual_mean_global` do?
> 1. Which script is applied for the diagnostic called `map`?
> 1. Can you link specific lines in the recipe to the tasks that we saw before?
> 1. How is the location of the city specified?
> 1. How is the temporal range of the data specified?
>
> > ## Answers
> >
> >   1. The example recipe is written by Bouwe Andela and Mattia Righi.
> >   1. Manuel Schlund is listed as the maintainer of this recipe.
> >   1. Two datasets are analysed:
> >      - CMIP6 data from the model BCC-ESM1
> >      - CMIP5 data from the model bcc-csm1-1
> >   1. The preprocessor `annual_mean_global` computes an area mean as well as
> >      annual means
> >   1. The diagnostic called `map` executes a script referred to as `script1`.
> >      This is a python script named `examples/diagnostic.py`
> >   1. There are two diagnostics: `map` and `timeseries`. Under the diagnostic
> >      `map` we find two tasks:
> >      - a preprocessor task called `tas`, applying the preprocessor called
> >        `to_degrees_c` to the variable `tas`.
> >      - a diagnostic task called `script1`, applying the script
> >        `examples/diagnostic.py` to the preprocessed data (`map/tas`).

## Modifying the example recipe

Let's make a small modification to the example recipe. Notice that now that
you have copied and edited the recipe, you can use in your working directory.

```
esmvaltool-workflow run recipe_python.yml
```

to refer to your local file rather than the default version shipped with
ESMValTool.

> ## Change your location
>
> Modify and run the recipe to analyse the temperature for your own location.
>
> > ## Solution
> >
> > In principle, you only have to modify the location
> > in the preprocessor called `annual_mean_amsterdam`. However, it is good
> > practice to also replace all instances of `amsterdam` with the correct name
> > of your location. Otherwise the log messages and output will be confusing.
> > You are free to modify the names of preprocessors or diagnostics.
> >
> > In the `diff` file below you will see the changes we have made to the file.

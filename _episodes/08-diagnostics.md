## Introduction

The diagnostic script is an important component of ESMValTool and it is where the
scientific analysis or performance metric is implemented. With ESMValTool, you
can adapt an existing diagnostic or write a new script from scratch.
Diagnostics can be written in a number of open source
languages such as Python, R, Julia and NCL but we will focus on understanding
and writing Python diagnostics in this lesson.

In this lesson, we will explain how to find an existing diagnostic and run it
using ESMValTool installed in editable/development mode. For a development
installation, see the instructions in the lesson [Development and
contribution]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/07-development-setup.md %}).
Also, we will work with the recipe [recipe_python.yml][recipe] and the
diagnostic script [diagnostic.py][diagnostic] called by this recipe that we have
seen in the lesson [Running your first recipe]({{ page.root }}{% link
_episodes/04-recipe.md %}).

Let's get started!

## Understanding an existing Python diagnostic

After a development mode installation, a folder called ``ESMValTool`` is created
in your working directory. This folder contains the source code of the tool. We
can find the recipe ``recipe_python.yml`` and the python script
``diagnostic.py`` in these directories:

- *path_to_ESMValTool/esmvaltool/recipes/examples/recipe_python.yml*
- *path_to_ESMValTool/esmvaltool/diag_scripts/examples/diagnostic.py*

Let's have look at the code in  ``diagnostic.py``.
For reference, we show the diagnostic code in the dropdown box below.
There are four main sections in the script:

- A description i.e. the ``docstring`` (line 1).
- Import statements (line 2-16).
- Functions that implement our analysis (line 21-101).
- A typical Python top-level script i.e. ``if __name__ == '__main__'`` (line
  102-107).

## Preprocesor-diagnostic interface

In the previous exercise, we have seen that the variable ``cfg`` is the input
argument of the ``main`` function. The first thing passed to the diagnostic
via the ``cfg`` dictionary is a path to a file called ``settings.yml``.
The ESMValTool documentation page provides an overview of what is in this file, see
[Diagnostic script interfaces][interface].

>> ## Answer

## Diagnostic shared functions

Looking at the code in  ``diagnostic.py``, we see that ``input_data`` is
read from the ``cfg`` dictionary (line 69). Now we can group the ``input_data``
according to some criteria such as the model or experiment. To do so,
ESMValTool provides many functions such as ``select_metadata`` (line 72),
``sorted_metadata`` (line 76), and ``group_metadata`` (line 80). As you can see
in line 8, these functions are imported from ``esmvaltool.diag_scripts.shared``
that means these are shared across several diagnostics scripts. A list of
available functions and their description can be found in 
[The ESMValTool Diagnostic API reference][shared].

## Diagnostic computation

After grouping and selecting data, we can read individual attributes (such as filename) 
of each item. Here we have grouped the input data  by ``variables`` 
so we loop over the variables (line 89-93). Following this, is a call to the 
function ``compute_diagnostic`` (line 94). Let's have a look at the
definition of this function in line 43 where the actual analysis on the data is done.

Note that output from the ESMValCore preprocessor is in the form of NetCDF files.
Here, ``compute_diagnostic`` uses
[Iris](https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) to read data
from a netCDF file and performs an operation ``squeeze`` to remove any dimensions
of length one. We can adapt this function to add our own analysis. As an
example, here we calculate the bias using the average of the data using Iris cubes. 

~~~python
def compute_diagnostic(filename):
    """Compute an example diagnostic."""
    logger.debug("Loading %s", filename)
    cube = iris.load_cube(filename)

    logger.debug("Running example computation")
    cube = iris.util.squeeze(cube)

    # Calculate a bias using the average of data
    cube.data = cube.core_data() - cube.data.mean()
    return cube
~~~

> Iris reads data from NetCDF files into data structures called
> [cubes](https://scitools-iris.readthedocs.io/en/latest/userguide/iris_cubes.html).

> plotted.

## Diagnostic output

### Plotting the output

Often, the end product of a diagnostic script is a plot or figure. The Iris cube
returned from the ``compute_diagnostic`` function (line 94) is passed to the
``plot_diagnostic`` function (line 101). Let's have a look at the definition of
this function in line 53. This is where we would plug in our plotting routine in the
diagnostic script.

More specifically, the ``quickplot`` function (line 61) can be replaced with the
function of our choice. As can be seen, this function uses
``**cfg['quickplot']`` as an input argument. If you look at the diagnostic
section in the recipe ``recipe_python.yml``, you see ``quickplot`` is a key
there:

```yaml
     script1:
       script: examples/diagnostic.py
        quickplot:
          plot_type: pcolormesh
          cmap: Reds
```

This way, we can pass arguments such as the type of
plot ``pcolormesh`` and the colormap ``cmap:Reds`` from the recipe to the 
``quickplot``  function in the diagnostic.

> ## Passing arguments from the recipe to the diagnostic
>
> Change the type of the plot and its colormap and inspect the output figure.
>
>> ## Answer
>>
>> In the recipe ``recipe_python.yml``, you could change ``plot_type`` and ``cmap``.
>> As an example, we choose ``plot_type: pcolor`` and ``cmap: BuGn``:
>>
>> ```yaml
>>     script1:
>>       script: examples/diagnostic.py
>>        quickplot:
>>          plot_type: pcolor
>>          cmap: BuGn
>>```
>>
>> The plot can be found at *path_to_recipe_output/plots/map/script1/png*.

> ESMValTool makes it possible to produce a wide array of plots and figures as seen
> in the [gallery](https://docs.esmvaltool.org/en/latest/gallery.html).
{: .callout}

### Saving the output

In our example, the function ``save_data`` in line 57 is used to save the Iris
cube. The saved files can be found under the ``work`` directory in a ``.nc`` format.
There is also the function ``save_figure`` in line 63 to save the plots under the 
``plot`` directory in a ``.png`` format (or preferred format specified in your 
configuration settings). Again, you may choose your own method
of saving the output. 

### Recording the provenance

When developing a diagnostic script, it is good practice to record
provenance. To do so, we use the function ``get_provenance_record`` (line 99).
Let us have a look at the definition of this function in line 21 where we
describe the diagnostic data and plot. Using the dictionary ``record``, it is
possible to add custom provenance to our diagnostics output. 
Provenance is stored in the *W3C PROV XML*
format and also in an *SVG* file under the ``work`` and ``plot`` directory. For
more information, see [recording provenance][provenance].

## Congratulations!

You now know the basic diagnostic script structure and some available tools for putting 
together your own diagnostics. Have a look at existing recipes and diagnostics in the 
repository for more examples of functions you can use in your diagnostics!

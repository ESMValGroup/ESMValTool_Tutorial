## ESMValTool

The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool, ESMValTool, is a python-based
software toolkit built to evaluate models of the Earths climate.

ESMVAlTool is made to be:

- Versatile
- Flexible
- Modular
- Standardised 
- Community driven

The toolkit is built with a sensible and modern code development process.
Where possible, we follow software development best practices,
including code review & monitoring, unit & integration testing,
and fully transparent design decisions.

ESMValTool is open source and available on github, and is written
in PEP8-compliant Python3.

- [ESMValTool Documentation page](https://docs.esmvaltool.org)


## ESMValTool_Tutorial

The ESMValTool tutorial was made to help people learn how to install, use,
and develop ESMValTool.

The tutorial uses the software carpentry format and tools, and can be
followed both independently and in a taught tutorial environment.

The tutorial has been produced by the ESMValTool User Engagement team,
and may be forked, developped and rehosted by other groups.

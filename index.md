This tutorial helps you to use ESMValTool.

The Earth System Model Evaluation Tool (ESMValTool) is a community developed
software toolkit that aims to facilitate the diagnosis and evaluation of the
causes and effects of model biases and inter-model spread within the CMIP model
ensemble.

This tutorial is structured into ``basic`` and ``advanced`` topics such that episodes 
starting from the [Introduction]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/01-introduction.md %}) up to the episode on [Conclusion of the basic tutorial]({{ page.root }}{% link _episodes/05-conclusions.md %})
all cover basic topics and can be done in one sitting. 

The remaining episodes cover the advanced topics and each episode is a
mini-tutorial covering an advanced aspect of working with ESMValTool. These
mini-tutorials can be appended to the main tutorial or worked through
independently.

2. Don’t be alarmed if you can’t work through the entire tutorial in one
   sitting. It may take some time to get used to working with ESMValTool.

3. If you get stuck, help is always available from the tutors, from ESMValTool
    developers via the [github issues
    page](https://github.com/ESMValGroup/ESMValTool/issues) or via the
    ESMValTool email list. Please see

    on how to subscribe to user mailing list.

4. This tutorial includes several advanced lessons after the conclusion. These
   advanced lessons should be treated like “mini-tutorials”, and include aspects
   like “developing your own diagnostic” or “how to include observations”.
